## Build

cadence.link is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), make sure that you have it installed first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloudMax94/cadence.link.git
```

Next you need to install the local JavaScript packages:
```bash

```bash
npm install -g postcss-cli
```
