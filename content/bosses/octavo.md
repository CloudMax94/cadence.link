The boss of [Hyrule Castle](/dungeons/hyrule-castle/).
The encounter is skipped if a player is Octavo.

Save files will store that Octavo has been beaten the moment that you defeat him, unlike other bosses.
You do not have to battle him again if you die after defeating him, or when restarting zone 5 in dungeon mode.
