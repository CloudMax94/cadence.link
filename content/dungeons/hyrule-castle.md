[Octavo](/bosses/octavo) is the boss of Hyrule Castle.
The encounter is skipped if a player is Octavo.

You can access Hyrule Castle early through [Barrier Skip](/sequence-breaks/barrier-skip/).

## Lobby Brazier

The most common method of lighting the Brazier is to use an explosive.
You can use glove to throw a bomb, or place a chu to have it blow up next to the brazier.

You can also light the brazier with a torch, as long as you can reach it. (Hookshot, Cane, Hover Boots)
It can also be lit using fire arrows or fire rod.

## Early Boss Key

### Permadeath Freeze

This method is very limited in unseeded runs as it has to meet 2 criteria:
- One of the two minibosses spawn by the chest.
- You have to be able to freeze that enemy type.

The vast majority of seeds do _not_ place an enemy by the chest, making this extremely unreliable unseeded.

### Permadeath Feather

**Exclusive to version 1.0.**

The lobby did not have invisible fences around the walls in 1.0, making it possible to reach the boss key early.

## Boss Key Skip

### Co-op Hookshot Displacement

**Exclusive to version 1.0.**

Thanks to [hookshot pivoting](/tech/hookshot-displacement/#hookshot-pivoting) we're able to hookshot past the boss door.

It is possible to do this without pivoting, but it requires additional items and setup.
