## 1F Skip

### Power Glove

If you have Cane of Somaria, it's faster to use that instead of the crate, and it also removes the need for fire/explosives.

### Slab

There are many different ways of skipping 1F using the slab by pushing it to the right, then down.
All you need is something to push the slab from a distance, or something that allows you to reach the slab.
You can do it with Hover Boots, Hookshot, Bow, Boomerang, Deku Leaf, Cane of Somaria, Spear Strafe, etc.
