Effects are cleared when leaving a dungeon.
This includes luting back to entrance and getting a game over.

The Future Hyrule Castle exterior is not part of the dungeon on save files made with the Symphony of the Mask DLC installed.
As a result it counts as leaving the dungeon, clearing all effects.
