The **Coin Multiplier** makes it's return from the Crypt of the Necrodancer into Cadence of Hyrule (Despite the terrible exchange rate from coins to rupees.) It works in almost exactly the same way - giving you a reward for keeping the rhythm.

The Multiplier starts at x1 and goes up to x3. You can increase the multiplier by defeating enemies. You can lose it when you miss the beat or take damage (includes self damage like running into a cactus).

To see the Multiplier level just look at the triforce peice at the bottom of the screen.

**x1**

**x2**

Defeat 5 total enemies and the multiplier increases to level 3.

**x3**

## Effects
There's a few things tied to the Coin Multiplier.

### Stamina Regeneration
The multiplier increases the amount of stamina gained per kill.

The formula is 5 * Coin Multiplier.

x1 = 5% of 1 stamina bar
x2 = 10%
x3 = 15%

*Note: It's 5%/10%/15% of a single stamina bar. Adding a second bar does not increase the regen rate*

### Loot
Item drops are improved as your Coin Multiplier increases. For example, with a 1 multiplier a mushboom can drop a single bomb. At x3, a mushboom will drop a 3-bomb pack instead.

This applies to the diamonds as well. With a x3 multiplier you'll get 2 diamonds instead of 1.

### Flawless Boss Rewards
Defeating a boss without breaking your multiplier will give you a flawless Boss Reward: a choice between a Blue Chest, a Red Chest, and 5 Diamonds.

### Obsidian Infusions
Obsidian Damage scales with the multiplier
x1 = 1 damage
x2 = 2 damage
x3 = 3 damage

## Dropping the beat
There's a hand of ways to drop the beat and reset your Groove Chain.

* Skip the beat
* Do more than one action
* Move while sliding on ice
* Take damage
* Load the game
* Activate the Shrine of Conga

It's unlikely, but sometimes you *want* to drop the beat. The fastest way tends to be pressing a direction twice in one beat. 


## Edge Cases

### Power Glove
The Power Glove has some special magic in them. Using the Glove will keep the beat, *even if you lift nothing at all*.

Which means you can use the Power Glove as a pseudo War Drum. Allowing you to stand still without dropping the beat. This is very useful when you have an obsidian weapon.

### Sliding on Ice
Even though you can't move while sliding on ice, you can still use items. This means you can save beats by doing 2 things at once, or you can perform some Frozen Grotto 1F skips.

Examples:
* Activate an Electric Scroll while sliding into the Wizzroboe fight.
* Create a block with the Cane of Somaria to stop yourself.
* Charge the Pegasus Anklet, turn, and release to dash off of the ice.
* Naryu's Love to protect yourself from enemies.
* Pull out the Longsword to stop yourself early.

### Item Fail
Failing to use an item does **NOT** drop the beat. It's like a null or non-action instead of a bad/invalid one. Examples of item fail would be tring to use the bow when you're quiver is empty. Or trying to use naryu's love without enough stamina. This also includes using an empty item.

If you fail to use an item, you can *still* do something else. The timing is a little strict, you need to fail to use an item and then do something after (you can't do 2 actions at the same time). This is useful to keep in mind when you're running low on stamina, surrounded by enemies, and trying to use naryu's love. Use naryu's love early in the beat and then do something else when it fails.

The one exception as mentioned above is the Power Glove. Failing to lift still consumes the beat.

### Ignoring the Beat
There's a few times where you can ignore the beat and not drop it.
* After you close the menu. This includes using the lute, then cancelling out.
* After you enter a new screen.
* When you're charging the Pegasus Anklet or holding the Bow.
