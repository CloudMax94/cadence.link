## Starting Area

Zelda starts in her bedroom, located in the north-east Hyrule Castle tower.
This area is only accessible when starting as zelda, adding a Sheikah Stone as well as a bridge to the bridge.

Zelda's Balcony makes traveling to Hyrule Castle Vault much quicker, and allows for things such as [Wrong Warp Barrier Skip](/sequence-breaks/barrier-skip/#wrong-warp-co-op) in co-op.
