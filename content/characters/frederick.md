## Items

Instead of being able to purchase items at his shops, he can leave items there for sale.
The items will sell after waiting a bit.

As a replacement for the dungeon shop key, a small key is placed inside of a wall instead.
_NOTE: It seems like there might be a generation issue which makes it so that the key isn't added sometimes._

The Telescope can be found in a red chest behind some dirt in Links house.
