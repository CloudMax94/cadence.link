After throwing a bombable rock you’re able to climb up on it as it is breaking.
Because the fall logic no longer run constantly in version 1.1, that means that you won’t actually fall down once the rock destruction animation completes, staying in mid-air.
This allows you to pick up a bombable rock, throw it onto the tile in front of you, and use it as a stepping stone to climb up ledges.

This is possible in other versions as well by using Rito Feather to cancel out your throw animation.
That way you're able to climb up the ledge before the rock animation completes.

_It’s called “**Bombable Rock**” because the internal name is rockBombable, even though the rock is actually thrown._
