When starting a new file in Story mode and choose between Link/Zelda, you can select one character to get vision around their start screen on the world map.
By then simply saving and quitting without waking them up, you'll return the the character selection, still having the vision.
Doing this does not increase ingame time since it does not start until you wake up the character you chose.
