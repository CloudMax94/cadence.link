**Exclusive to version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1.**

By picking up a bomb while it is exploding, the bomb won't despawn, staying indefinitely.
Weirdbombs can not be kicked, allowing you to walk over them, making placement easy to deal with.
This is especially useful in combination with [spawn displacement](/tech/spawn-displacement/).
