This is likely an intended mechanic.

When an item is used multiple times within a single beat, only one ammo is used. Can be seen in co-op.
This also applies to the Ganon fight where you control multiple characters, and only one bomb/chu/arrow is spent.
In fixed-beat co-op both players have to use the items at the exact same time, otherwise the first player would cause the next beat.
