**This page is a work in progress, bear with me!**

By luting away from Ganon through various means, you keep the characters that are added for the fight.

## Effects

### Persisting Screen Coordinates

The extra characters retain their screen coordinates when doing any kind of transition.
This allows you to traverse maps very quickly, and reach places which are otherwise unreachable.

### Disabled Lute

After luting away from Ganon, the lute remains disabled. You can however still warp around using the map screen.
By starting co-op (or exiting and re-entering co-op), player 2 will be able to use their lute as normal.

### Boss Music

...This is where we'd explain how things differ because the music/beat is in the boss encounter state...

### Entrance Climbing

...

### Timestop
**Exclusive to version 1.0.**

By starting a dialogue with an extra character, you will activate [time stop](/tech/time-stop/).

## Activation Methods

### Map Screen

**Exclusive to version 1.4.**

Files made with the Symphony of the Mask DLC use the overworld map screen instead of the dungeon map screen while in Ganon's room.
While the Lute is disabled during the boss encounter, you're still able to warp using the map screen.

### Pre-luting

By luting before or as you trigger the boss fight, you're able to trigger the fight while/before luting away from the room.
