## Pegasus Cancel
_Alternatively: **Anklet Cancel**_

By unequipping Pegasus Anklet before activating it, it is cancelled.

This allows you to use pegasus anklet for pivoting.
If timed well in fixed-beat, it's possible to pivot in just 1 beat.

### 1.1 & 1.0 differences

In version 1.1 and 1.0 you can also re-equip the anklet over itself and unpause while still holding the button.

## Bow Cancel

**Exclusive to version 1.0 and 1.1.**

By unequipping Bow before activating it, it is cancelled.
You can also re-equip the bow over itself and unpause while still holding the button.
Any kind of interaction where you lost control of your character will also Bow Cancel. Stuns, cutscenes, transitions, etc.
While playing with beat, you can also bow cancel by simply pressing and releasing the bow within a single beat so that you get a missed beat.

It allows you to use the bow in just 1 beat. Step count is not increased.
The arrow will still be fired, but it will not move, only hitting targets on the immediate adjacent tile.
This is primarily used to allow you to pivot in any direction in just one beat, called **1 Beat Pivot** or **Bow Cancel Pivot**.

In co-op you're able to hit the other player with bow cancelling.

### 1.0 differences

An added side-effect of Bow Cancelling in 1.0 is that the arrow can hit targets of any height.
It will look for a target at any height, starting at the top and working its way down.
The first target that is found is hit, while all the others below are left untouched. This can be seen by stacking slabs, for example.
It also allows you to hit leevers that are burrowed, zora that are submerged, and wizzrobes that are invisible. And probably more.

## Throw Cancel

**Exclusive to version 1.0 and 1.1.**

_Alternatively: **Glove Cancel** or **Bomb Cancel**_

By re-equipping the Power Glove over itself, the game will automatically throw whatever youâ€™re holding, if it can be thrown at your current location.

Just like with Bow Cancel, this does not cause a beat, allowing you to throw things inbetween beats.
