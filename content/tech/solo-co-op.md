**Exclusive to version 1.4 - 1.1.**

This allows you to start a co-op file without player 2 present, which also results in you not having the character they chose unlocked.
It is important to note that the save file still is flagged as having played co-op, meaning that the file will use the co-op leaderboards.

This glitch is used to perform [World Shuffle](/tech/world-shuffle).

Steps:
1. Enter co-op on any file
2. Save and Quit while still in co-op
3. Go to New Game 2P
4. Before starting the file, unassign the controller of player 2
5. Start Game
6. When asked to assign two controllers, only assign one, then back out of the dialog
_If you didn't save & quit while in co-op as mentioned in step 2, it will continue to ask for 2 controllers_
_Otherwise you'll hear the sound effect of player 2 being removed and it will will ask you to assign just 1 controller_
7. Assign a controller and continue

## Player 2 Character

When you perform this glitch, the save file will not have the character of player 2 unlocked, if it was different from player 1.
However, if you start co-op again, Player 2 will still have their character assigned from the file creation, allowing you to play as it without it being unlocked.
If you interact with a Sheikah Stone at any point while in co-op, the game will realize that player 2 is using an unavailable character and swap it out.
You are not able to swap back to the initial player 2 at this point.
