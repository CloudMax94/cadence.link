**Exclusive to version 1.0.**

Allows you to climb up entrances as if they were stairs by preventing the entrance transition from activating.

You can prevent the transition by triggering a tutorial or catching a fish with player 2 at the same time as player 1 enters the entrance.

You can also use spells and items that cause _immediate_ knockback on use, such as Deku Leaf, Din's Fire and throwing a standable entity. (Does not work with pots, bushes, etc.)
This does _not_ with knockback from bombs, enemies, boomerang, etc. since they're processed after both players turns. Player 1 must be moved before their turns end and everything else is processed.
