**Exclusive to version 1.0.**

The spawn location of player 2 when starting co-op at a Sheikah Stone is not the Sheikah Stone, but the tile in front of player 1.
This means that by moving or pivoting as you interact with a Sheikah Stone, you're able to alter the spawn location of player 2.
Tile height, fences and even screen boundaries are ignored.
