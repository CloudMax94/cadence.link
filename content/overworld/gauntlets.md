The gauntlets are numbered after their internal filenames, gauntlet01 through gauntlet05.
Gauntlets can be mirrored. When left or right is specified, it refers to their default orientation, as seen in the renders.

## Gauntlet 1

{{< poi "Gauntlet/gauntlet01" >}}

### From Left  - Spawn Displacement

Requires that you do not have flippers.
Since enemies block their adjacent tiles as well, it is easy to block all tiles except one twice to the right.
