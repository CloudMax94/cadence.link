The cliffs biome is always along the north border.

## Death Mountain

Death Mountain is a 3x2 sized POI within the Cliffs biome. It is the home of [Temple of Storms](/dungeons/temple-of-storms/).

There is a Cadence Cave at the main entrance of Death Mountain.

There is also a blue chest with an [Obsidian Dagger](/general/items/#weapons), as well as a Heart Piece.

There is a hidden cave at the very center of the map behind the large waterfall.
The entrance is hidden behind a cliff next to two Armos.

### ToS Shortcut

Within the cliff biome there is always a shortcut directly south of Temple of Storms.
It allows quicker access if certain conditions are met.

**TODO: Add common examples**

## Windmill Hut

Windmill Hut is always located directly south of Death Mountains centerpoint.
It has a Purple Chest which doesn't require anything to reach.
It also has a [music note puzzle](/general/music-notes/#windmill) which gives you [Down Thrust](/general/items/#passives).
Down Thrust location is randomized in Permadeath mode.

### Windmill Maze

**TODO: Add a clean clip of doing the maze without any items**

**With Power Glove**
